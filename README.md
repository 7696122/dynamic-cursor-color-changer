smart-cursor-color-mode
============================

Change cursor-color dynamically on Emacs.

iTerm.app have `smart cursor color'.

But GNU Emacs deosn't have this option.

The `smart-cursor-color-mode' can make do that.

Quickstart

To make the mode enabled every time Emacs starts, add the following
to Emacs initialisation file (~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el):

If installed from elpa.
`      (smart-cursor-color-mode +1)
`
If installed manually,
`      (add-to-list 'load-path "path-to-installed-directory")
      (require 'smart-cursor-color)
      (smart-cursor-color-mode +1)
`
